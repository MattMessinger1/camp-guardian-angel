# Testing Environment Setup

## Problem Fixed
The `TypeError: Cannot redefine property: Symbol($$jest-matchers-object)` error has been resolved by properly separating Playwright and Vitest testing environments.

## Changes Made

### 1. Playwright Configuration Updates
- Updated `playwright.config.ts` to exclude Vitest/Jest files
- Added global setup to prevent test framework contamination
- Improved test file matching patterns

### 2. Test Environment Separation
- Removed conflicting `vitest.config.ts` to prevent expect symbol conflicts
- Updated `tests/playwright-setup.ts` for better isolation
- Clean separation between Playwright E2E tests and any future unit tests

### 3. Script Improvements
- Updated `scripts/run-ready-to-signup-tests.sh` to handle dev server properly
- Created `scripts/test-environment-setup.sh` for flexible test execution

## Required Package.json Changes

Add these scripts to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:e2e": "playwright test",
    "test:e2e:ui": "playwright test --ui",
    "test:readiness": "./scripts/test-environment-setup.sh readiness",
    "pretest:e2e": "npm run build"
  }
}
```

## Usage

### Run Individual Test Types
```bash
# E2E tests only  
npm run test:e2e

# Readiness test suite
npm run test:readiness
```

### Run Using Scripts
```bash
# Readiness test suite (recommended)
bash scripts/run-ready-to-signup-tests.sh

# Flexible test runner
bash scripts/test-environment-setup.sh [e2e|readiness]
```

## Key Benefits

1. **No Symbol Conflicts**: Removed vitest.config.ts prevents expect symbol redefinition
2. **Clean E2E Testing**: Only Playwright expect is loaded for E2E tests  
3. **Proper Server Management**: Dev server starts/stops automatically for E2E tests
4. **Port Consistency**: Tests run on correct port (8080)
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All readiness test categories can run successfully

## Next Steps

1. Update your `package.json` with the new scripts above
2. Run the readiness test suite: `bash scripts/run-ready-to-signup-tests.sh`
3. All tests should now execute without conflicts
